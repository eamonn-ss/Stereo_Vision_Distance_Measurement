# Stereo_Vision_Distance_Measurement
## Overview
This project performs distance estimation using a stereo camera system mounted on a model car, and runs on the Jetson Nano located on the car. You can choose to use two IMX219-160 cameras to form a stereo vision system, or use the IMX219-83 stereo camera.
